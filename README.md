# nTerm2-S
My rendition of the uTerm2-S by Just4Fun (https://hackaday.io/project/181583-uterm2-s-a-multi-emulation-color-rs232-terminal). This one is in SMD, and I hopefully made it easily hand-solderable for everyone (with maybe the exception of the CP2102). Obviously the 'n' in nTerm stands for 'nano.' :P

The nTerm2-S has a slightly more usable form the uTerm2-S, I think. Smaller and a little more usable when sitting permanently on a desk. And as an extra, it can switch between normal and cross (null-modem) from the software so that you wil never have to search for that null-modem cable ever again. It can also switch between RTS/CTS or DTR/DSR handshaking.
